> An Amazon Transcribe (JSON) to Word (docx) converter for multi-speaker transcriptions

A small script to help convert a multi-speaker Amazon Transcribe JSON to Word Document (docx).

Given a JSON transcript, a Word document with clean output is produced. Output is organised by speaker and time, followed by what was said by each speaker. Phrases are colored based on the transcription confidence from Amazon Transcribe.

I don't really plan on maintaining this, just thought it might be useful to others. Feel free to open a PR, though.
