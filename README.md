# Amazon Transcribe - JSON to DOCX Parser for multi-speaker transcriptions

This is just a small script that I wrote to help convert a multi-speaker Amazon Transcribe JSON to Word Document.

It gives you a nice output organised by speaker and time, followed by what they said. It also colourises the words based on their confidence.

I don't really plan on maintaining this, just thought it might be useful to others :)
